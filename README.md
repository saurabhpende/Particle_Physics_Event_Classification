# Particle_Physics_Event_Classification
Particle accelerators enable physicists to explore the fundamental nature of matter by observing subatomic particles produced by high-energy collisions of particle beams. The experimental measurements from these collisions inevitably lack precision, which is where machine learning (ML) comes into picture. The research community typically relies on standardized machine learning software packages for the analysis of the data obtained from such experiments and spends a huge amount of effort towards improving statistical power by extracting features of significance, derived from the raw measurements.
In the field of particle physics, accurate identification and classification of events are crucial for understanding fundamental particles and their interactions. the provided dataset contains various features derived from particle physics experiments, and the goal is to build a machine-learning model to classify events into signal (s) and background (b) categories. this classification aids in distinguishing events of interest (signal) from background noise.
I develop a model that can accurately predict whether a given set of experimental features corresponds to a signal or background event. Successful classification contributes to the advancement of particle physics research by automating the identification of events that may indicate the presence of specific particles or phenomena.
