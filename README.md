# Particle_Physics_Event_Classification
IN THE FIELD OF PARTICLE PHYSICS, ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF EVENTS ARE CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. THE PROVIDED DATASET CONTAINS VARIOUS FEATURES DERIVED FROM PARTICLE PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS, AND THE GOAL IS TO BUILD A MACHINE-LEARNING MODEL TO CLASSIFY EVENTS INTO SIGNAL (s) AND BACKGROUND (b) CATEGORIES. THIS CLASSIFICATION AIDS IN DISTINGUISHING EVENTS OF INTEREST (SIGNAL) FROM BACKGROUND NOISE.

I develop a model that can accurately predict whether a given set of experimental features corresponds to a signal or background event. Successful classification contributes to the advancement of particle physics research by automating the identification of events that may indicate the presence of specific particles or phenomena.
